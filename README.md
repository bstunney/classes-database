I created this database management system project during July 2022. 

Using SQL scripts, and python script with Create, Read, Update, and Delete capabilities, this project allows for local storage and querying of classes and grades data.
I created this project because logging into Northeastern's grades portal takes forever, and I wanted to create an easy way to test how my gpa would be affected depending on the outcome of a given semesters' grades.

Once a connection has been established with SQL (I used MySQL workbench), the python script can be ran to use CRUD operations, get current GPA, or to run a test semester.

required imports: pymysql
